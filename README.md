# Deep-Gait-Recognition-
Project: Deep Learning for Gait Biometrics: A Siamese MobilenetV2 Approach on the CASIA Gait B Dataset
Gait recognition has recently received attention due to the potential implications it may 
have in a variety of domains, including security, healthcare, and human-computer 
interaction. The process of identifying individuals based on their walking patterns presents a 
non-invasive and effective biometric modality. However, existing gait recognition methods 
often struggle with challenges such as varying camera angles, walking speeds, and clothing, 
which hinder their performance and limit their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this 
project, I aimed to develop a robust gait recognition system capable of overcoming these 
challenges and accurately identifying individuals based on their walking patterns. my goals
were to develop a deep learning-based gait recognition model, evaluate the model's 
performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve, 
and to learn discriminative features from a dataset of gait sequences effectively. To achieve 
these objectives, I employed a Siamese network architecture based on the pre-trained 
MobileNetV2 model. This architecture enabled me to leverage the powerful feature 
extraction capabilities of the MobileNetV2 model while adapting it for gait recognition tasks.
my methodology involved preprocessing the input gait images, augmenting the training 
data, and training the Siamese network using a dataset of gait sequences split into training, 
validation, and test sets. The results of my experiments demonstrated that the proposed 
gait recognition model achieved high performance across all evaluation metrics. The model 
achieved test accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC values of 0.99, 0.99, 1.0, 
and 1.0, respectively. These results indicate that my model successfully met the objectives 
outlined for this project and has the potential to be employed in various real-world gait 
recognition applications. In conclusion, my deep learning-based gait identification system 
has the ability to progress the field further and shows promise in addressing the gait 
recognition issues. Future work may include exploring additional data augmentation 
techniques, integrating the model with other biometric modalities, and refining the model 
architecture for improved performance
